    <p>Github has a lot of diffrent uses, but that in it's self isn't why Github is important. Github is a popular control system that people and teachers use to be able to make a live website, or to make an assignment.
    Basic Github knowlegde is needed for a lot of job here are some examples</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Software Engineer</li>
      <li>Web Developer</li>
      <li>UX Designer</li>
      <li>Game Programmers</li>
      <li>Ect...</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Like I said basic Github knowledge is needed for a lot of jobs, but why? Well is shows that you are good with computers, and in this century that is a really good thing to know how to do.
    Since everything now is about technology. Github knowledge also looks really good on a resume, just knowing how to make a live website on Github, can land you a really good job that pays a lot of money. How much money you ask? Well most computer type jobs pay a pretty good amount. Here are some examples. </p>
    <table align="center">
      <th>Jobs</th>
      <th>Money Earned (Per Hour)</th>
        <tr>
          <td>Computer Engineer</td>
          <td>$55.73</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Game Programmers</td>
          <td>$48.12</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Web Developer</td>
          <td>$59</td>

        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Thats a lot of money huh. As you can see knowing a little bit of Github, can actually help you get a good job and help you get enough money to be able to pay for every day expenses. Which now a days is really important. Now you don't have to learn Github to get a good job, but it helps you get a job a lot faster.
    </p>
    <p>This is why Github is important, it helps to get good paying jobs, and it can even give you a scholarship. I don't know about you, but that sounds like a good idea to me.</p>
